A career-high 31 points from reserve guard Donte DiVincenzo propelled Villanova past Michigan for the Wildcats' second national championship in three seasons. The Wildcats, who won each of their six NCAA Tournament games by double digits, trailed by seven points midway through the first half before switching gears and dominating play the rest of the way. Villanova ended Michigan’s nation-leading 14-game winning streak and won its 11th game in a row to establish a new program record for wins in a season (36).
    DiVincenzo, who entered the contest averaging 13 points per game, came off the bench to ring up 18 of Villanova’s 37 first-half points. The sophomore went 10 of 15 from the floor – including a 5-of-7 showing from 3-point range. Named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, DiVincenzo added five rebounds, three assists and a game-high two blocks.
    Villanova is the first team since North Carolina in 2005 to win the national championship as the highest-scoring team in the nation.
    Mikal Bridges, who registered 19 points, was Villanova’s only starter to reach double digits in points.
    Villanova, which also won a national title in 1985, is 13-1 in NCAA Tournament play over the last three seasons.
    After Michigan took its largest lead of the game at 21-14 with 11 minutes left in the first half, Villanova closed the first half by scoring 23 of the next 30 points for a 37-28 halftime lead. The final basket of the extended burst was a 3-pointer from Jalen Brunson 44 seconds before the half.
