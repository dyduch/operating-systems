A career-high 31 points from reserve guard Donte DiVincenzo propelled Villanova past Michigan for the Wildcats' second national championship in three seasons. The Wildcats, who won each of their six NCAA Tournament games by double digits, trailed by seven points midway through the first half before switching gears and dominating play the rest of the way. Villanova ended Michigan’s nation-leading 14-game winning streak and won its 11th game in a row to establish a new program record for wins in a season (36).
